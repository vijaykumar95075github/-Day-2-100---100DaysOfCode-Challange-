 Challenge: Write a program to check if a given character is an alphabet or not.

ðŸŽ¯ Task Overview:

Today, I worked on a simple but essential problem that involves identifying whether an input character is an alphabet letter. It may sound basic, but mastering these core concepts helps in building the foundation for more advanced programming. The challenge was to take a single character as input and determine if itâ€™s part of the alphabet (A-Z or a-z).

ðŸ“¥ Input:

A single character, which could be a letter, number, or special character.

ðŸ“¤ Output:

If the character is an alphabet letter, print: "Alphabet".

If itâ€™s anything else, print: "Not an alphabet".
